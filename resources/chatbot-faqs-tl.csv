Your Best Defense Against a Fire is to Plan Ahead. 
Learn the layout of your room and how to unlock the door in the dark. Put your room key and a flashlight close to where you sleep. In the event of fire, take your room key, flashlight and nothing else with you.
REMINDER
Do not smoke in bed. The most common cause of deadly hotel fires is smoking.
• Locate 2 exits nearest your room. Be sure they are unlocked and unblocked.
• When you hear an alarm, ACT, do not simply investigate.
• If the fire is in your room, get out and close the door. Alert your neighbors. Once out, report the fire and please proceed to the nearest ground-floor open area that is safely away from the fire.
• If the fire is not in your room, leave if you can. First, feel the door. If it is cool, open it slowly and go to the nearest exit. Crawl if there is smoke. Fresher air will be at the floor.
• If your door is hot, do not open it. Your room may be the safest place to be. Seal all cracks with wet towels. Shut off fans and air conditioners. Signal from your window. Call the fire department and wait to be rescued.
• If the smoke detector in your room beeps, please do not remove it. Dial 0 from room telephone and inform the front desk.",Guest Directory,Travelodge Florida City-Homestead,32c52141-e66a-4019-9947-286d2b82f1b4,9/25/23

We urge you to take advantage of the following suggestions - we hope that these procedures will contribute to your comfort and well-being during your stay:
1. Do not answer the door in the hotel room without verifying who is there. If a person claims to be an employee, call the front desk and ask if someone from hotel staff is supposed to have access to your room and for what purpose. Do not admit persons to your room without first making identification. A peephole is provided in your door for your convenience. If there is any doubt about a person’s true identity, please contact the front desk.  Please do not allow any outside visitors into your room.
2. When returning to the hotel late in the evening, use the main entrance of the hotel. Be observant and look around before entering parking lots, and before leaving your vehicle.
3. Close the door securely whenever you are in your room and use all of the locking devices provided.

As an additional precaution, please secure the safety chain or bar lock.
4. Do not needlessly display guest room keys in public or carelessly leave them on restaurant tables, at the swimming pool, or other places where they might be stolen. Safeguard your key. Be sure to leave it with the front desk upon departure. Do not leave the room key in your room or in the door. Do not give your room key to others.
5. Do not draw attention to yourself by displaying large amounts of cash or expensive jewelry.
6. Do not invite strangers to your room for any reason.
7. Place all valuables in the hotel's office safety deposit box.  Please contact the front desk to utilize the office safety deposit box.
8. Ensure that your car is locked, and do not leave any items of value in your car.
9. Check to see that any sliding glass doors or windows and any connecting room doors are locked.
10. If you are traveling with children, provide adult supervision and know their whereabouts at all times.
11. If you see any suspicious activity, please report your observations to the management.
12. Sometimes you may get suspicious calls to your room; if so, please do not give any personal or credit card information over the phone. Instead, please take down the caller’s phone number and request to call them back. Then, immediately call the Front Desk to verify if the call was legitimate.
